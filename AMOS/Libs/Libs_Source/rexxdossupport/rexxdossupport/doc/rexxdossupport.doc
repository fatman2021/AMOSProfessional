                ==========================

         Copyright (C) 1994-1997 by hartmut Goebel


   After programming ARexx script for quite a while, I missed some
   function found in dos.library --  especially access to
   environment variables and the comfortable argument parsing. Since
   there seamed to be no ARexx function library which implements
   this functions, I decited to write my own. And here it is.

   This are the functions handled by this library.
    ReadArgs()
    GetVar(), SetVar(), DeleteVar()
    ParsePattern(), MatchPattern() - even case-insensitive
    Fault()
    Delete(), Rename(), MakeDir()
    SetComment(), SetProtection()
    FilePart(), PathPart(), AddPart()

   This additional functions have been added for your convinience:
    AbsolutePath()

   Enjoy it!

rexxdossupport.library/--installation--rexxdossupport.library/--installation--

   To use rexxdossupport.library, just copy is to yout LIBS:
   directory. That's all.

   The LVO for the ARexx-Dispatcher is -30.
       NB: it's the only LVO for this library :-)

   So, in every ARexx-Script you want to use rexxdossupport.library,
   insert

      call addlib("rexxdossupport.library",0,-30,2)

   somewhere before the first call to one of the routines
   implemented in this library.
   Since ARexx does not check whether the lib can be opened but only
   inserts the name into a list, the result value from addlib() can
   be ignored in most cases. The value would be interesting to check
   if the added note will require the same library version, but I
   don't know how to find this out.

rexxdossupport.library/AbsolutePath       rexxdossupport.library/AbsolutePath

   NAME
       AbsolutePath -- Returns the fully qualified path of a file or dir (V3)

   SYNOPSIS
       path = AbsolutePath( name )

   FUNCTION
       Determines the absolute path of a file or directory.

   INPUTS
       name  - file or directory name

   RESULT
       path  - absolute path to file/dir

       RC (rexx variable) - 5 when file does not exist,
                            0 otherwise

   EXAMPLE
       /* */
       path = AbsolutePath(":s/Startup-Sequence")
       if RC = 5 then
         say "File ':s/Startup-Sequence' does not exist"
       else
         say "':s/Startup-Sequence' is '" || path || "'"

   SEE ALSO

rexxdossupport.library/AddPart                 rexxdossupport.library/AddPart

   NAME
       AddPart -- Appends a file/dir to the end of a path (V3)

   SYNOPSIS
       newpath = AddPart( dirname , filename )

   FUNCTION
       This funktion adds a file, directory, or subpath name to a
       directory path name taking into account any required
       seperator charakters.

   INPUTS
       dirname  - the path to add a fir/directory name to.
       filename - the filename or directory name to add.

   RESULT
       newpath  - resulting path.

       RC (rexx variable) - 5 when file does not exist,
                            0 otherwise

   EXAMPLE
       /* */
       path = AddPart("System:s/","Startup-Sequence")
       if RC = 0 then say path
         /* --> System:s/Startup-Sequence */

       path = AddPart("System:s/bla",":Startup-Sequence")
       if RC = 0 then say path
         /* --> System:Startup-Sequence */

       path = AddPart("System:s/bla","/Startup-Sequence")
       if RC = 0 then say path
         /* --> System:s/bla//Startup-Sequence */

       path = AddPart("System:s/bla","") /* fine trick :-) */
       if RC = 0 then say path
         /* --> System:s/bla/ */
   BUGS
       Neither the input dirname nor the resulting path must exceed
       511 Bytes. If a string overflow occurrs, error 'string too
       long' will be returned which ARexx outputs as 'string > 65535
       charakters'.

rexxdossupport.library/Delete                   rexxdossupport.library/Delete

   NAME
       Delete -- Delete a file or directory (V2)

   SYNOPSIS
       success = Delete( name )

   FUNCTION
       This attempts to delete the file or directory specified by
       'name'. If the deletion fails an error is returned and the
       rexx variable RC is set. Note that all the files within a
       directory must be deleted before the directory itself can be
       deleted.

   INPUTS
       name     - name of file or directory to delete.

   RESULT
       success - If TRUE, the file was sucessfully deleted,
                 FALSE indicates failure.

       RC (rexx variable) - contains the dos error code if the
               function was not successfull. This can can directly
               be used as input for Fault().

   SEE ALSO
       Fault(), dos.library/DeleteFile()

rexxdossupport.library/DeleteVar             rexxdossupport.library/DeleteVar

   NAME
       DeleteVar -- Deletes a local or environment variable

   SYNOPSIS
       success = DeleteVar( name, [ "Local" | "Global" ] )

   FUNCTION
       Deletes a local or environment variable.

   INPUTS
       name     - variable name.  Note variable names follow
                  filesystem syntax and semantics.
       "Global" - tries to get a global env variable.
       "Local"  - tries to get a local variable (see note below).

                The default is to delete a local variable if found, otherwise
                a global environment variable if found.

   RESULT
       success - If TRUE, the variable was sucessfully deleted,
                 FALSE indicates failure.

   NOTES
      Since ARexx spawn a new process of each script -- even if
      started from Shell -- option "Local" may not work as supposed.

       GetVar(), SetVar(), dos.library/DeleteVar()

rexxdossupport.library/Fault                     rexxdossupport.library/Fault

   NAME
       Fault -- Returns the text associated with a DOS error code

   SYNOPSIS
       string = Fault( code, header )

   FUNCTION
       This routine obtains the error message text for the given
       error code. The header is prepended to the text of the error
       message, followed by a colon. By convention, error messages
       should be no longer than 80 characters, and preferably no
       more than 60.

       The value returned by IoErr() (not available in this library)
       is set to the code passed in. If there is no message for the
       error code, the message will be "Error code <number>\n".

       The string will be empty if the code passed in was 0.

   INPUTS
       code   - Error code
       header - header to output before error text

   RESULT
       string - error massage as described above.

       RC (rexx variable) - 5 when error message is empty
                            0 otherwise

   BUGS
      I've been told that this function returns only an empty sting.
      Since nobody gave me further information, I can't fix it.

rexxdossupport.library/FilePart               rexxdossupport.library/FilePart

   NAME
       FilePart -- Returns the last component of a path (V3)

   SYNOPSIS
       part = FilePart( path )

   FUNCTION
       This function returns the last component of a string path
       specification, which will normally be the file name.  If there is
       only one component, it returns the complete string.

   INPUTS
       path - pointer to an path string.  May be relative to the current
              directory or the current disk.

   RESULT
       part  - resulting path part.

   EXAMPLE
       /* */
       say FilePart("xxx:yyy/zzz/qqq")
         /* --> qqq */
       say FilePart("xxx:yyy")
         /* --> yyy */

rexxdossupport.library/GetVar                   rexxdossupport.library/GetVar

   NAME
       GetVar -- Returns the value of a local or global variable

   SYNOPSIS
       string = GetVar( name, ["Local" | "Global"], ["Binary"] )

   FUNCTION
       Gets the value of a local or environment variable.  It is advised to
       only use ASCII strings inside variables, but not required.  This stops
       putting characters into the destination when a \n is hit, unless
       "Binary" is specified.  (The \n is not stored in the buffer.)

   INPUTS
       name     - variable name.
       "Global" - tries to get a global env variable.
       "Local"  - tries to get a local variable (see note below).
       "Binary" - don't stop at \n
                  in this mode the string returned is not null terminated

                The default is to try to get a local variable first,
                then to try to get a global environment variable.

   RESULT
       string - contents of the variable

       RC (rexx variable) - 5 when variable does not exist,
                            0 otherwise

   EXAMPLE
       /* */
       username = GetVar("username")
       if RC = 5 then
         say "Variable 'username' is not set"
       else
         say "Variable 'username' is" username

   NOTES
      Contents may be max. 512 char.

      Since ARexx spawns a new process of each script -- even if
      started from Shell -- option "Local" may not work as supposed.

   NAME
       MakeDir -- Create a new directory (V2)

   SYNOPSIS
       success = MakeDir( name )

   FUNCTION
       MakeDir creates a new directory with the specified name. If
       it fails an error is returned and the rexx variable RC is
       set.  Directories can only be created on devices which
       support them, e.g. disks.

   INPUTS
       name     - name of directory to create

   RESULT
       success - If TRUE, the variable was sucessfully deleted,
                 FALSE indicates failure.

       RC (rexx variable) - contains the dos error code if the
               function was not successfull. This can can directly
               be used as input for Fault().

   NAME
       MatchPattern --  Checks for a pattern match with a string

   SYNOPSIS
       match = MatchPattern(pattern, string, ["Nocase"], ["Parsed"] )

   FUNCTION
       Checks for a pattern match with a string.
       This routine is case-sensitive by default. Use option
       "NoCase" for case-insensitve matching.

       Use option "Parsed" to indicate that pattern has already been
       tokenized using ParsePattern(). Make sure to use or use not
       "NoCase" for both function.

   INPUTS
       pattern  - pattern string to match
       string   - string to match against given pattern
       "Nocase" - match should be case-insensitve
       "Parsed" - pattern has already been parsed using ParsePattern()

   RESULT
       match - success or failure of pattern match.

rexxdossupport.library/ParsePattern       rexxdossupport.library/ParsePattern

   NAME
       ParsePattern -- Create a tokenized string for MatchPattern()

   SYNOPSIS
       token = ParsePattern( pattern, ["NoCase"] )

   FUNCTION
       Tokenizes a pattern, for use by MatchPattern().  Also indicates
       if there are any wildcards in the pattern (i.e. whether it might match
       more than one item).

       For a description of the wildcards, see dos.library/ParsePattern().

   INPUTS
       pattern  - unparsed wildcard string to search for.

   RESULT
       token    - output string, tokenized version of input.

       RC (rexx variable) - 5 when does not contain wildcards
                            0 otherwise

   BUGS
       Since is't not clear wether the resulting token may contain
       null charakters, the returned string is always
       2 * Length(pattern) + 2 bytes long.

   NAME
       PathPart -- Strips the next-to-last component of a path. (V3)

   SYNOPSIS
       part = PathPart( path )

   FUNCTION
       This function strips the next-to-last component of a path
       specification, which will normally result in the directory name.
       If there is only one component, it returns an empty string.

   INPUTS
       path - path string.  May be relative to the current directory or
             the current disk.

   RESULT
       part  - resulting path part.

   EXAMPLE

rexxdossupport.library/ReadArgs               rexxdossupport.library/ReadArgs

   NAME
       ReadArgs -- Parse argument string using Dos/ReadArgs()

   SYNOPSIS
       okay = ReadArgs( arguments, template, [stem] )

   FUNCTION
       Parses an argument string according to a template. See
       dos.library/ReadArgs() for details and describtion of the
       template.

       This function supports the following template options:

       /S - Switch.  Resulting variable will be either true (1) or
            false (0).
       /T - Toggle.  (V3) Results like /S, but much more mighty,
                     see below.
       /N - Number.
       /M - Multiple strings.  See below for further information.

       /K - Keyword.      }
       /A - Required.     }  handled by dos
       /F - Rest of line. }

   INPUTS
       arguments - the string to be parsed
       template  - dos.library/ReadArgs()-style like template
       stem      - stem prefix for resulting variables (optional)

       For /T arguments the corresponding variable (see RESULTS) is read
       to get the default.  The variable must be either false (0) or true
       (1).  If the variable does not exist, the default is false (0).

   RESULT
       okay  - boolean value indicating success.

       RC (rexx variable) - contains the dos error code if the
               function was not successfull. This can can directly
               be used as input for Fault().

       For each item in the template which has a corresponding
       argument, a Rexx variable will be created. The variable's
       name is the item's name prefixed by the stem name (if given). If
       an item name has synonyms, the first one will be taken as variable
       name.

       Items with option /M will result in a stem variable with a
       .COUNT node containing the number of elements. If no fitting
       arguments is passed, .COUNT will be zero.
       The entries will be in stem nodes .0 to .n (where n is
       .COUNT-1).

   EXAMPLE
       /* ReadArgsExample.rexx */
       If ~show('L', 'rexxdossupport.library') then do

   NOTE
      /T was unsupported till V 3.1

   NOTE
      Some background about /T which is not documented well:
      /T acts very like /S but may be set to on/off using the keywords
      'YES'/'ON' and 'NO'/'OFF'. This is usefull when parsing eg.
      tool-types or using multible option-sources (eg. defaults taken
      from an environment variable).

                                  /S             /T
        1st option-set          UseScreen     UseScreen=YES
        2nd option-set        NoUseScreen     UseScreen=NO
          --> results into   ??confusion??    UseScreen=NO

   NAME
       Rename -- Rename a directory or file (V2)

   SYNOPSIS
       success = Rename( oldName, newName )

   FUNCTION
       Rename() attempts to rename the file or directory specified
       as 'oldName' with the name 'newName'. If the file or
       directory 'newName' exists, Rename() fails and returns an
       error. Both 'oldName' and the 'newName' can contain a
       directory specification. In this case, the file will be moved
       from one directory to another.

       Note: it is impossible to Rename() a file from one volume to
       another.

   INPUTS
       oldName - pointer to a null-terminated string
       newName - pointer to a null-terminated string

   RESULT
       success - If TRUE, the variable was sucessfully deleted,
                 FALSE indicates failure.

       RC (rexx variable) - contains the dos error code if the
               function was not successfull. This can can directly
               be used as input for Fault().

rexxdossupport.library/SetComment           rexxdossupport.library/SetComment

   NAME
       SetComment -- Change a files' comment string (V2)

   SYNOPSIS
       success = SetComment( name, comment )

   FUNCTION
       SetComment() sets a comment on a file or directory. The
       comment may be up to 80 characters in the current ROM
       filesystem (and RAM:).  Note that not all filesystems will
       support comments (for example, NFS usually will not), or the
       size of comment supported may vary.

   INPUTS
       name     - name of file or directory to set comment
       comment  - comment to be set

   RESULT
       success - If TRUE, the variable was sucessfully deleted,
                 FALSE indicates failure.

       RC (rexx variable) - contains the dos error code if the
               function was not successfull. This can can directly
               be used as input for Fault().

   NAME
       SetProtection -- Set protection for a file or directory (V2)

   SYNOPSIS
       success = SetProtection( name, mask )

   FUNCTION
       SetProtection() sets the protection attributes on a file or
       directory.  See <dos/dos.h> for a listing of protection bits.

       The archive bit should be cleared by the filesystem whenever
       the file is changed.  Backup utilities will generally set the
       bit after backing up each file.

       The V36 Shell looks at the execute bit, and will refuse to
       execute a file if it is set.

       Other bits will be defined in the <dos/dos.h>include files.
       Rather than referring to bits by number you should use the
       definitions in <dos/dos.h>.

   INPUTS
       name     - name of file or directory to set protection
       mask     - the protection mask required

   RESULT
       success - If TRUE, the variable was sucessfully deleted,
                 FALSE indicates failure.

       RC (rexx variable) - contains the dos error code if the
               function was not successfull. This can can directly
               be used as input for Fault().

rexxdossupport.library/SetVar                   rexxdossupport.library/SetVar

   NAME
       SetVar -- Sets a local or environment variable

   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       success = SetVar( name, ["Local" | "Global"] )

   FUNCTION
       Sets a local or environment variable.  It is advised to only use
       ASCII strings inside variables, but not required.

   INPUTS
       name     - variable name.
       "Global" - tries to get a global env variable.
       "Local"  - tries to get a local variable (see note below).

               The default is to set a local environment variable.

   RESULT
       success - If non-zero, the variable was sucessfully set, FALSE
                 indicates failure.

   NOTES
      Since ARexx spawn a new process of each script -- even if
      started from Shell -- option "Local" may not work as supposed.
