About this Manual
=================

   Since the first release of ASM-One (V1.01, programmed by Rune
Gram-Madsen), TFA added many new instructions, commands, directives
etc. etc.

   V1.01 probaly had a printed manual (German). V1.02 (released by
Venture) had the printed manual as an ASCII file on disk, as well as
a small english version.

   Up untill version V1.15 of ASM-One, those manuals did cover most
of ASM-One's functions. But after V1.15, there where more and more
differences after every new release of ASM-One. Those manuals where
therefore left out.

   Around version V1.20 I (Boushh) translated the original German
manual to Dutch (mainly for my convenience). But this was on paper
and the programs used to edit the text, where non-Amiga programs, so
it was no good idea to include it into a new release.

   Since then, many ideas have been send to use. And we discovered that
quite a lot of these ideas where already build into ASM-One. But nobody
knew, becose they where not documented. But also new users had absolutly
no idea what ASM-One could do.

   Therefore I decided to finaly put all the features of ASM-One in
one AmigaGuide. And you are looking at it B-)

   I did my best to make it as complete as possible, but if you have
any suggestions, they are welcom.

P.S. ASM-One hase been cloned quite much. Many of these clones (like
Trash'm-One (Deftronic), AsmPro (Genetic), etc, etc, will have most
of ASM-One's functionality. So, if you are a user of those clones,
you can use the manual as well B-)


But.... Why should you use a clone when you can use the original ??

What is ASM-One ?
=================

   ASM-One is an intergrated assembler developing environment. Where other
assemblers (commercial of PD) offer some intergration, or only CLI
execution, ASM-One offers everything in one package.

   ASM-One consists of:

- An Editor
- An Assembler
- A  Debugger
- A  Monitor

   ASM-One gives you the possibility to develop your software without
browsing through several programs. Everything you need is available
right at your hands.

Before you mail me a bug or an idea, please READ this manual and
check out our webpages !!!!


			Mailing Bugs & Ideas
			--------------------

If you mail Ideas:

- Tell as exactely as you can how you think your idea should work.
- If possible, include sourcecode of your idea (WB/KS 2.x compatible).

If you mail bugs:

- Be as detailed as possible.
- Write down what you did, AND what the result was.
- Include sample sourcecode, generating the error (if possible).
- Include your system configuration (get that with tools/Showconfig).
- Include your ASM-One.Pref file.

                          ASM-One & RTG
                          -------------

As of ASM-One V1.46, ASM-One can work with RTG screens.

There is a switch called 'RTG Mode' in the Environment Preferences
which let you select if ASM-One uses it's RTG routines.

When selected, ASM-One should show up on any Screen (both RTG and
normal Amiga Screens).

When not selected, ASM-One will use it's 'Bang-the-Hardware'
routines. And thus will not show up on a RTG Screen.

The reason for both ways is that people who do not have a Graphics
Card will not loose speed.

So if you start ASM-One and you only see a box, change your
Environment Preferences (Amiga+[). And make sure you save them.


			RTG Considerations
			------------------

When starting ASM-One, it first checks if you have KS/WB 3.x. This
is essential since the RTG routines REQUIRE KS/WB 3.x to work.

If you do not have KS/WB 3.x, ASM-One will disable it's RTG
code and switch back to the old 'Banging-the-Hardware' routines.
It will also gray-out the 'RTG Mode' option in the Environment
Preferences to prevent you from accidentialy choosing to use
ASM-One's RTG Mode.

If ASM-One could not open your selected screen (which has nothing
to do with the RTG option) it will put up a requester so you can
select a new screenmode instead of trying to open a PAL or NTSC screen.

Anyways, check the Environment Preferences and make SURE they
reflect what you want !!!

For the best and fastest results:

Screen	      | RTG Mode
--------------+---------
CyberGraphiX  | On
Picasso96     | On
AmigaForever  | On
UAE           | On
Amiga OCS     | Off
Amiga ECS     | Off
Amiga AGA     | Off

@NODE "Starting" "Starting with ASM-One"
@TOC "Main"

                         Starting ASM-One
			 ----------------

Here's is an example of a first session with ASM-One:


Starting
--------

Start ASM-One from the CLI (a Shell) or by double clicking on it's icon.


First Steps
-----------

After ASM-One is started, you will get the following line:

	ALLOCATE Fast/Chip/Publ/Abs>

Here you can select in which kind of memory your source will be located.

F = FastMem
C = ChipMem
P = PublicMem (the largest available memory block)
A = Absolute

(Remember: Images and sounds that are to be used by the Amiga's native
chipset, need to be in CHIP memory. Or the custom chips will not be
able to get to the data. It is however good practice to store your
source into so called Public Memory. Public Memory is normally FAST
memory, unless there is no FAST Memory, then it will be CHIP memory.
You can always use the SECTION directive to allocate the correct memory)


After you have selected where your source should be located, you will
have to choose how large the allocated block of memory should be:

	WORKSPACE (Max.7680) KB>

After Max. is the largest available block of memory available.

(Remember: the allocted block needs to be large enough to hold the source,
anything that use the INCBIN directive, labels and such !! However,
includes are not stored in this area)

Now you are ready to rock & roll B-)

Loading a source
----------------

Type R after the >, and a requester will show up.

Select the source you want to work with.


Going to the Editor
-------------------

Press the ESC key to go into the Editor

(If you don't have a source to work with, press the ESC key to go into
the Editor and make your own source.)

Assembling a source
-------------------

Press ESC to go to the > again.

Type A (Assemble), and ASM-One will assemble your source.

If any errors occure, press ESC and go into the Editor to correct them.

Writing an object
-----------------

After you have assembled a source, you have an object (executable file).
You can save the object by typing WO (Write Object) at the >.

If you assembled a source that's not executable, type WB (Write Binary)
at the >.

If you have made changes to your source, type U (Update) at the >.

If you made a new source, type W (Write) at the >.

What means DLCs ?
----------------

   DLCs is short for: "Direct Line Command(s)". You issue a DLC at the
Command Line Interperter (CLI) of ASM-One. This CLI is the place where you
normaly start. It begins with the ">".

NAME
   =F - Change the Font of ASM-One

SYNTAX
   =F

FUNCTION
   When Reqtools enabled, you will get a Font Requester with the
   following functions:

   Ok     - Will install the new font, but WILL NOT save it
   Cancel - Will cancel the Font Requester

RESULT
   Changed or NOT changed font.

REMARKS
   ASM-One can ONLY handle 8*8 fixed fonts. Default the requester
   will only show 8 pixels height fonts. But the font maybe to
   width for ASM-One. The only way to check this is to select the
   topaz.font, and remember where te last character was. And compare
   that position with the font you want to select.

   Changes will be made directly, accept for the menu's.

   Save the changes with @{" Write Prefereces " LINK "WP_DLC"} or by choosing
   SAVE within the Preferences.

FROM VERSION
   V1.30

BUGS
   If you select a font, and the requester says: 'Couldn't open Font'.
   Than DON'T SELECT it. If you do, ASM-One will use the default font
   (currently: topaz.font). But '=F' will no longer work.

SYNTAX

FUNCTION
   Will show info on the requested Amiga Register.

INPUT
   Nothing, or a [registernumber]. The [registernumber] should
   be the last three numbers of the hexadecimal address of the
   register

EXAMPLE

   >=R 1EC
    1EC   W  A          VRam (UHRES) bitplane pointer (hi 5 bits).:

    BPLHPTH - UHRES (VRAM) bit plane pntr (high 5 bits)
    BPLHPTL - UHRES (VRAM) bit plane pntr (low 15 bits)

         When UHRES is enabled, this pointer comes out on the 2nd 'free' cycle
         after the start of each horizontal line. It`s modulo is added every
         time it comes out. 'free' means priority above the copper and below
         the fixed stuff (audio,sprites....).
         BPLHDAT comes out as an identifier on the RGA lines when the pointer
         address is valid so that external detectors can use this to do the
         special cycle for the VRAMs, The SHRHDAT gets the first and third
         free cycles.

RESULT
   If no [registernumber] was given, an explenation of the used
   symbols and a complete list of ALL Amiga registers.
   Otherwise the requested register (if the number was valid).

   The inexact and infinity flags only work at the commandline !!
   Since during debugging ASM-One can not recognize which FPU register
   caused the inexact/infinity flag it will ignore them !!!

SYNTAX
   AO

KEY-SHORTCUT
   Right-Amiga+Shift+O

FUNCTION
   ASM-One will start assembling your source. And optimize it when
   needed.

   ASM-One will only optimize branches from WORD to BYTE, and from
   BYTE to WORD.

   When Optimizing from Byte to Word, ASM-One will ALLWAYS start
   reassembling. Since locations of labels AFTER the optimization
   will be changed from those locations ASM-One got during it's
   Pass 1.

   This also happens when you normally assemble a source. So the
   only advantage of AO is currently the optimization of WORD to
   BYTE.

   An optimization will result in a CHANGED source !!

RESULT
   An optimized piece of code B-)

REMARKS  
   ASM-One also optimizes CLR.L Dn -> MOVEQ #0,Dn during assembling.

   ASM-One will also change CMP/ADD/SUB instructions to appropiate
   instructions (like CMP.x (An)+,(An)+ -> CMPM.x (An)+,(An)+)
   during assembling.

   But ASM-One WILL NOT change your source for these optimizations !!
   ONLY the assembled code....

   Other optimizations are under construction. Including changing
   your source.

   Optimizing can take some time if your source is big and a lot has to be
   optimized. ASM-One has to move your source the be able to add
   characters to it.

NAME
   D - Edit Disassembled Memory

SYNTAX
   D[address/label]

FUNCTION
   You will jump to the monitor starting at the specified address
   or label. If you didn't specify an address or label, the Monitor
   will disassemble memory from address $0.

INPUT
   Address or label or nothing.

RESULT
   Disassembled memory in the Monitor.

REMARKS
   If you want to disassemble your source (by using a label) you
   first have to assemble your source, otherwise ASM-One will not
   recognize the label.

SYNTAX

FUNCTION
   Loads the External binaries which where defined in the source

   Loads the External binary with the specified [number] if a number
   was specified by @{" >EXTERN " LINK "Directive.Guide/dir_EXTERN"}.

RESULT
   The External binaries will be loaded at the specified addresse(s).

REMARKS
   This command is here for backwards compatibility with SEKA. It's
   better (and saver) to use @{" INCBIN " LINK "Directive.Guide/dir_INCBIN"} for including binaries,
   becose EXTERN will load binaries at an ABSOLUTE memory address, while
   INCBIN will load binaries at a RELATIVE address.

SYNTAX

FUNCTION
   Some programs need CLI input (like DIR) to function properly.
   With PS you can set the CLI parameters.

INPUT
   Startup parameters>  The parameters

RESULT
   The parameters (text) will be stored in a memory location. 
   Every time you start debugging, the address of this location
   is put into A0 (just like the real thing B-)

   D0 will contain how many characters there where (including
   the trailing $a).

REMARKS
   PS will save the parameters, so you don't have to enter them
   every time you debug some source. So A0 will ALLWAYS point
   to the parameters, and D0 will ALLWAYS contain there number
   (only AFTER you once specified the parameters).

   The text will always be ended with an $a (= RETURN).

RESULT
   Will show TWO addresses. The first is the address from
   the byte in the first block that is different from the
   byte at the address shown as the second address (which
   should be in the second block).

   If no differences where found, you will get the following
   message:

   ** Equal Areas

   If any difference was found:

   <first address> <second address>
   ** NOT Equal Areas

REMARKS
   You can't specify the end of the second block. That's not
   strange, since you will compare memory against the first
   block. Everything that's bigger than the first block,
   will not be intresting to compare.

   block (which is: (END-BEG)+DEST).

			ASM-One.Pref File
			-----------------

The ASM-One.Pref file holds all the preferences that can be set and
saved.

Sometimes it's handy to know WHAT it all means, so you can change
preferences without starting ASM-One (or maybe you changed something
so you can't start ASM-One anymore B-)

ASM-One also has some default preferences build-in. These are the
preferences I (Boushh) use myself. They are ONLY used when no
ASM-One.Pref file was found (it should be located in the ENVARC:
directory).

Once you made a workable ASM-One.Pref file, make a copy ! It may
come in handy..

Here are the possible codes that could be in your ASM-One.Pref file:
(a PLUS sign means: Active, a MINUS sign means: INactive).

RS
--

Rescue Source - Believe it or not, but with this on ASM-One will
try to save your source, so you can retrieve it using the @{" O " LINK "O_DLC"}
DLC.

L7
--

Level 7 - Will start ASM-One's own Level 7 code. A level 7 interrupt
can only be activated by adding external/extra hardware to your
Amiga (like the Action Replay Cartridge).

NL
--

NumLock - If ON, the nummeric keypad will function like cursor keys:

	7 - Top		8 - Up		9 - Page Up
	4 - Left	5 - Center	6 - Right
	1 - Bottum	2 - Down	3 - Page Down

AA
--

AutoAlloc - if ON. ASM-One will locate the CORRECT memory for your
section. If OFF: your sections will be placed where there is room in
memory. It's a good thing to set this option ON, specialy when you
work with ChipMem.

RL
--

ReqTools - If ON, ASM-One will use the ReqTools.library for all it's
requesters. If OFF, you will save some 8 Kb of memory.

XR
--

Extended ReqTools - If ON, also the search/replace functions will
have requesters (instead of being in the menubar).

PD
--

Printer Dump - This option will activate the dumping of text to
the printer. This includes the DLC's.

LF
--

List File - If ON, will list the complete file, with line numbers,
addresses, the assembled code, the source as comment and a list of all
used symbols.

PG
--

Paging - If ON, will start a new page after the previous on was full.


HP
--

Halt Page - If ON, will stop after the screen has been filled with data
(in combination with Paging).

AE
--

All Errors - If ON, will assemble, regardless of the errors found.
ASM-One will keep the location of 100 errors/warnings, after assembly
you can reach the with Amiga+e.

DB
--

Debug - If ON, could spare time when debugging. Because ASM-One will
NOT reassemble the source if nothing was changed.

IL
--

InterLaced - If ON, will activate InterLace (not fully functional
anymore in R399e, will be skipped in later releases).

REMARK: No longer supported after V1.46 !!!

1B
--

One Bitplane - If ON, will start ASM-One with only ONE bitplane, to
save memory (As of ASM-One V1.45, this item has no function any more.
You also can no longer set it in the Environment Preferences).

REMARK: No longer supported after V1.46 !!

CB
--

Clipboard Support - If ON, Copies and Pastes will be send/retreived
from the clipboard so you can share your stuff with other applications
and visa versa.

Functional since V1.45

.S
--

Source .S - If ON, will use the specified source-extension when
writing source.

CW
--

Close WorkBench - If ON, ASm-One will try to close the WorkBench to
save memory.

LN
--

Line Numbers - If ON, shows line numbers.

AI
--

Auto Indent - If ON, will set the tabs for you.

L:
--

Label : - If ON, ALL labels have to be ending with a colon.

DA

disassembled in the debugger.

SS
--

ShowSource - If ON, will change the debugger in a SourceLevel Debugger.
If OFF, the actual assembled code will be shown in the debugger,
instead of the Source.

OA
--

Only ASCII - If ON, will skip unreadble characters when viewing
memory in ASCII.

UL
--

UpperCase = LowerCase - If ON, ASM-One will make no difference
between Upper- and LowerCase. Should be OFF when using the
Official Amiga includes !!!!

;C
--

;Comment - If ON, comments HAVE to be preceded by a semi-colon.

PI
--

Progress Indicator - If ON, will show how much ASM-One has
assembled of your source.

PL
--

Progress Line - If ON, ASM-One will show which line is assembled.

PS
--

Startup Parameters - If ON, will allow you to debug sources like
if they where executed form the CLI with parameters. Use the
@{" PS " LINK "PS_DLC"} DLC to set the parameters.

RR
--

Resident Registers - If ON, will make the REGSDATA file resident
in memory if called upon the first time. If OFF, the REGSDATA file
will be closed after each action (see the @{" =R " LINK "=R_DLC"} DLC).

AU
--

Update Check - If ON, ASM-One will only update sources that have
been changed. If OFF, ASM-One will ALWAYS update the source.

SM
--

Save Marks - If ON, will save the 10 marks you can make in the

use the @{" WN " LINK "WN_DLC"} DLC.

FW/PW
--

Processor Warn - If ON, Processor warns will not be displayed.

FP
--

FPU Present - If ON, makes ASM-One believe you have a real FPU
in your Amiga (so ASM-One will skip FPU specific warnings and
errors).

OD
--

68020++ Odd Data - If ON, ASM-One will NOT give any errors if
data (and ONLY data) is at an odd address.

DC
--

DS Clear - If ON, ASM-One will clear BSS sections for you
automatically. But remember, the Amiga will NOT clear BSS
sections for you if you start your program outside ASM-One.

UD

		M68000 Family Mnemonic Description
		----------------------------------

If you would program in Assembler some 15 years ago, you would be programming
numbers. This is becose the processor ONLY knows the number 0 and 1 (the 
binary number system).

Programming in 0's and 1's is a painstaking job, so people invented the
Octal number system (representing 8 binary numbers) and the Hexadecimal
number system (representing 16 binary numbers).

But people still used numbers to program in assembler.

Then someone had the briliant idea of giving names to the hexadecimal
numbers: Mnemonics...

So Mnemonics are alphabetical representations of numbers. And they allow
todays assembler programmers to program in assembler quite easly.

An Assembler (like ASM-One) translates the Mnemonics to numbers again, so
the processor understands them.

			   Thanks to...
			   ------------

I like to thank:

- Rune Gram-Madsen, for the most excelent ASM-One V1.01
- Price, for developing ASM-One from 1991 through 1997
- All those people who use ASM-One (you keep me going B-)
- The ORIGINAL Amiga Team, for developing THE greatest computer of all time...

My taglines:

- Keep supporting the ORIGINAL Amiga !!!
- TFA, Artists with an Attitude



			  !!   ORIGINAL !!

YES, those people who worked on the Amiga until Commodore went bankrupt.

Sure, maybe the new AmigaDE will be a software revolution. But no Amiga
build by the AmigaDE specification will EVER come close to the combination
of hardware & software of the Original (today also called 'Classic') Amiga.


Don't get me wrong. I like what the AmigaDE can do, and I like the idea's
behind it. The ONLY mistake THEY made was to maintain the AMIGA name.


Besides the ill fathed BoXer, no company in the world is currently developing
a NextGen Amiga. And it's SAD to realize that.
